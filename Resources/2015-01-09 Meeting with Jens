Other Notes: 
--------
- Grammars should be confluent, complete, etc... need to look up properities (handbook?)
- Will likely need to prove properties of my grammars
- Need to check grammar type for ANTLR4 and make an argument that it is suitable for this use
- Programming language properties of Syntax, Semanitics, Pragmatics.
- Need to make sure that every possible input to the DSL has a semantic meaning in the petrinet. 
- might consider adding route to core APMA model.
