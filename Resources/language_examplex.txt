##Prescription Language Examples

###General Structure of Input

The input is generally structured as: 

`<ACTION> <MEDICATION> <DOSING> <TIMING>` 

These must always occur in this order. The details of how these are broken down can be gleaned from examining the ANTLR4 grammar file. 

###1. Basic I

`take aspirin 81 mg once daily FOR 60 days`

* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `81 mg`
* Timing: `once daily FOR 10 days`

###2. Basic II

`take aspirin 81 mg twice daily FOR 60 days`

* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `81 mg`
* Timing: `twice daily FOR 60 days`

###3. Basic III

`take aspirin 81 mg 3 times daily FOR 60 days`

* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `81 mg`
* Timing: `3 times daily FOR 60 days`

###4. Specific Time

This describes taking 81 mg of aspirin at 8AM and again at 8PM.

`take aspirin 81 mg twice daily (8, 20) FOR 10 days`

* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `81 mg`
* Timing: `twice daily (8, 20) FOR 10 days`

If a specific timing is not specified the doses are spread out even throughout a 24 hour period. 

###5. Specific Dose

This example shows how dosing can vary in time. Since no times are specified, the doses are spread out across the 24 hour period. 

`take aspirin (81 mg, 100 mg) twice daily FOR 10 days`.


* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `(81 mg, 100 mg)`
* Timing: `twice daily FOR 10 days`

###6. Specific Dose and Time

This shows how specific doses and times can be combined. At 8AM take 100 mg of aspirin, at 8PM take 200 mg of aspirin. 

`take aspirin (100 mg, 200 mg) twice daily (8, 20) FOR 10 days`


* Action: `take`
* Medication: `aspirin`
* Dosing: `(81 mg, 100 mg)`
* Timing: `twice daily (8, 20) FOR 10 days`

###7. Sequencing Several Instructions

Several instructions can be sequenced together using the `THEN` keyword. 

    take aspirin 81 mg twice daily FOR 10 days 
        THEN take aspirin 100 mg twice daily FOR 20 days
    
* Action1: `take`
* Medication1: `aspirin`
* Dosing1: `81 mg`
* Timing1: `twice daily FOR 10 days`


* Action2: `take`
* Medication2: `aspirin`
* Dosing2: `100 mg`
* Timing2: `twice daily FOR 20 days`


###8. Concurrent Instructions

***NOT IMPLEMENTED*** *This is my idea for an extensions of the language, but I left it out of scope for the thesis work. Might be interesting to mention though.* 

We can specify actions to happen concurrently using the `AND` keyword. 
    
    take aspirin 81 mg twice daily FOR 10 days
        AND take penicillin 100 mg once daily FOR 7 days
    
###9. Titrating Medications

Titrating is the act of changing dose of medication at a constant rate over time. E.g. increase by 1 mg per day over 1 week. We can specify increasing or decreasing doses. 

    take aspirin TITRATE down FROM 100 mg TO 0 mg BY 10 mg per day 
        once daily FOR 10 days
        
* Action1: `take`
* Medication1: `aspirin`
* Dosing1: `TITRATE down FROM 100 mg TO 10 mg BY 10 mg per day`
* Timing1: `once daily FOR 10 days`

This can be expressed more verbosely as: 

    take aspirin 100 mg once daily FOR 1 day 
        THEN take aspirin 90 mg once daily FOR 1 day
        THEN take aspirin 80 mg once daily FOR 1 day
        ...
        THEN take aspirin 10 mg once daily FOR 1 day
