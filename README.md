# Prescribing DSL
A prototype implementation of a domain specific language for creating prescriptions for my Honours Thesis at UVic.

##Project Motitvation

Clinical Information Systems (CIS) are becoming increasingly prelvenet in our health care system. One of the advantages to CIS's is the ability for them to provide advanced decision support to health care professionals. However, clinical decision support systems rely on data that has been entered by a human; this data must be well structured and in format that the computer understands. Coversely, humans prefer to use natural language to describe clinical concepts (such as prescriptions). However, natural language processing for free text is currently a very difficult problem, and will likely not be solved for some time. The code in this repository is a prototype system for author semi-natural language prescriptions.
